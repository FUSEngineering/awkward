# The special variable NR stores the total number of input records read so far, regardless of how many files have been read.
# The value of NR starts at 1 and always increases until the program terminates. 

awk 'NR % 6'            # prints all lines except those divisible by 6
awk 'NR > 5'            # prints from line 6 onwards (like tail -n +6, or sed '1,5d')
awk '$2 == "foo"'       # prints lines where the second field is "foo"
awk 'NF >= 6'           # prints lines with 6 or more fields
awk '/foo/ && /bar/'    # prints lines that match /foo/ and /bar/, in any order
awk '/foo/ && !/bar/'   # prints lines that match /foo/ but not /bar/
awk '/foo/ || /bar/'    # prints lines that match /foo/ or /bar/ (like grep -e 'foo' -e 'bar')
awk '/foo/,/bar/'       # prints from line matching /foo/ to line matching /bar/, inclusive
awk 'NF'                # prints only nonempty lines (or: removes empty lines, where NF==0)
awk 'NF--'              # removes last field and prints the line
awk '$0 = NR" "$0'      # prepends line numbers (assignments are valid in conditions)

awk 'NR==FNR { # some actions; next} # other condition {# other actions}' file1 file2
awk 'NR==FNR{a[$0];next} $0 in a' file1 file2 # prints lines that are both in file1 and file2 (intersection)
